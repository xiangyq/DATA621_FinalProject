## Exploring the Relationship between Macroeconomic Indicators and Public Survery Responses to Economic Questions

**Abstract**

The link between consumer sentiment and macroeconomic conditions may be studied by public surveys. We attempt to answer the question “does public sentiment about the economy reflect measured macroeconomic indicators?” and show that demographic factors such as income and education level attained are better predictors of a survey respondent’s assessment of the economy than official measures of economic activity.
